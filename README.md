# Predictive-Analysis-of-Hit-Songs-Using-Repeated-Chorus
In this work, we examined this myth by creating a data set of choruses from popular artists and applied five supervised Machine Learning techniques to predict the popularity purely based on the audio features extracted from a 15s chorus. Using a Neural Network, we were able to demonstrate the performance of the model that is better than random. Hence, we conclude the myth is plausible.
